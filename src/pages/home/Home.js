                    <p>I am a professional web developer where I am excited at the prospect of being challenged every day.
                        I work as a junior developer for Active Interest Media. Here I am a full stack
                        developer working with python, django, aws, javascript along with many other systems.
                    </p>
                   <p> I started teaching myself programming while I was in my previous position. I was stuck with the
                       tedious prospect of compairing multiple excel sheets for orders in my area, getting that order number
                       then comparing that with a different excel sheet for delivery date, and comparing that to again a different
                       excel sheet.
                       I had always been interested in programming but never pulled the trigger. This was the catalyst.
                       I studied python and used an excel library to get my code working. I then packaged it up using Tkinter
                       and let other people in my role to use the program I built.
                       This started a love for programming and I have never regretted the time commitment or the decision.
                       I look forward to the future where I can continually challenge myself and excel in what I do.
                   </p>
