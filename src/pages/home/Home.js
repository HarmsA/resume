                        <p>I am a professional web developer where I am excited at the prospect of being challenged every day.
                            I work as a developer for Active Interest Media. I am a full stack
                            developer working with Python, Django, AWS, Javascript along with many other systems.
                        </p>
                       <p> I started teaching myself programming while I was in my previous position. In that job, I was
                           comparing multiple excel sheets for orders in my area. I first needed to get the
                           devices that were delivered that day. Then I needed the order number.  That number was
                           compared with a different Excel sheet for an install date.  Then I needed to compare that to
                           another Excel sheet for customers who purchased training in addition to their order.
                           This was a perfect job for Python.
                       </p>
                        <p>
                          I studied Python and used an Excel library to get my code working.  I packaged it using Python's
                            builtin library, Tkinter for the UI.  Once it was complete, I shared the program with
                            colleagues for their use as well. This use of Python to create a program for my company became the catalyst to start a career in programming.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           This began a love for programming and  I have been grateful for the time commitment and the
                            decision to move forward in this career path. I look forward to the future where I can
                            continually challenge myself and excel in all that I do.
                        </p>
