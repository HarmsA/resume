                        I originally built this site in Django, then later recreated it as a React.js demo. While I didnâ€™t develop the live version, I played a key role in assisting with its build. My brother, the owner of Emmre, hired a social media marketer with some programming knowledge to develop the site in WordPress. When that developer struggled with features or styling, I stepped in, despite not specializing in WordPress, to successfully implement every requested functionality.
